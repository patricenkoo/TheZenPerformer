Managing emotions through images is among the most difficult challenges to overcome within an organization. Images can help to share emotions or even better to share a vision. Many papers during the past years explored problems related to images identification or classification. 

Deep Coaching, a Convolutional Neural Network embedded in a Reinforcement Learning Model, called The Zen Performer®, is used to generate images in order to improve the communication between different agents within an organization.

According to the 2015 Davos World Economic Forum, 80% of employees feel stress within their working environment. The Zen Performer® is built to help people to better manage their emotions.

Technology can give the opportunity to employees to better manage their emotions, and to companies to alter their the business cultures for the better of our society. 

The role of the Human Resources was to help employees to cope with any human issues, but technology is completely changing the business landscape. For instance, bots as Alexa and Siri, may become your  virtual business coaches in a near future.

With so many IoT coaching tools, coming to the market, thanks to the development of Artificial Intelligence, it will become very difficult for employees to find the right solution to manage their emotions at work, without losing their focus.

The Zen Performer® main goal is to close this gap, not only by connecting any types of IoT tools from its AI platform, but also by creating an environment, where employees will have the opportunity to communicate with other peers through generated images, and by so doing,  improved their  alignment vis à vis of the company strategic vision, which is also defined in term of images.
